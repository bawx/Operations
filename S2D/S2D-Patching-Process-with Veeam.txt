Defining the process for patching with Veeam - HCI Cluster Nodes Hot Patching
#.5 - Advise the Team of Patching
#1 Disable the Veeam Backup and Replica Job
#2 Disable the Remote Replica Jobs
#3 Disable the Backup Jobs
#2 Run the Job for the Local Target only - For a quick local restore
#3 Check access to IPMI - BMC Cold Reset if you can't access
#4 Validate remote console access
#5 Put Cluster in Maintenance Mode Veeam One Alerting
#6 Ensure that the is N-RAM Free Space --> If 256 GB of RAM must be lower than total 240 GB of RAM in use in the cluster for failover fail back
#7 If required shut down non critical workloads to achieve #6
#8 Check the cluster Witness, Cluster Name Object, Cluster IP, Cluster Networks
#9 Run Get-Physicaldisk - ensure no errors
#10 Run Get-VirtualDisk - ensure no errors
#11 Run Get-StorageJob - eunsure no jobs / Get-dedupjob
#12 Run Get-StoragePool - Validate health
#13 Working on 1st Node - Ensure that Cluster Service is set to disabled Don't Stop the Service
#14 Pause the node and Drain Roles - Dave likes to drain manually  - Live Migrating
#15 Ensure the VM's are working start a Ping -t to several VM's
#16 Start a Ping -t to the cluster node being patched
#17 Once Live Migrations have completed Pause the Node
#18 Move Cluster Core Resource to the other Node
#19 Move the CSV Ownership to the other Node
#20 Move the Cluster Pool Ownership to the other Node
#21 Optional - Configure Storage Maint Mode --> We disable the Cluster Service so in effect kind of the same idea
#22 Run Windows update pass #1 - Reboot
#23 While Rebooting go to the Console IPMI Screen and make sure everything is good on reboot 
#24 Checking Pings to make sure Cluster is still online
#25 Upon Reboot login and run another Windows Update pass and reboot #2
#26 While Rebooting go to the console IPMI Screen and make sure everything is good on reboot
#27 Checking pings to make sure cluster is still online
#28 upon Reboot login and run another Windows Update pass and reboot #3
#29 Checking pings to make sure cluster is still online
#30 Login and check event logs for errors
#31 Change the Cluster Service back to Automatic
#32 Open Failover CLuster Manager and Start the Cluster Service
#33 Node should show paused leave it this way for now
#34 open Admin PowerShell and run Get-StorageJob - Waiting for Jobs to complete
#35 run get-virtual disk - Disks should show healthy and not degraded or detached
#36 run get-storagepool make sure everything is healthy
#37 if healthy - Unpause the node and Livemigrate roles back
#38 Check pings on VM's should only drop 1 ping when moving back
#39 Check the cluster Witness, Cluster Name Object, Cluster IP, Cluster Networks
#40 Run Get-Physicaldisk - ensure no errors
#41 Run Get-VirtualDisk - ensure no errors
#42 Run Get-StorageJob - eunsure no jobs
#43 Run Get-StoragePool - Validate health
#44 Working on 2nd Node - Ensure that Cluster Service is set to disabled Don't Stop the Service
#45 Pause the node and Drain Roles - Dave likes to drain manually  - Live Migrating
#46 Ensure the VM's are working start a Ping -t to several VM's
#46-a Make sure all VM's are online and none are in a failed state --> Like the MX Patching where Loren went down and had to be failed over..
#47 Start a Ping -t to the cluster node being patched
#48 Once Live Migrations have completed Pause the Node
#49 Move Cluster Core Resource to the other Node
#50 Move the CSV Ownership to the other Node
#51 Move the Cluster Pool Ownership to the other Node
#52 Optional - Configure Storage Maint Mode --> We disable the Cluster Service so in effect kind of the same idea
#53 Run Windows update pass #1 - Reboot
#54 While Rebooting go to the Console IPMI Screen and make sure everything is good on reboot 
#55 Checking Pings to make sure Cluster is still online
#56 Upon Reboot login and run another Windows Update pass and reboot #2
#57 While Rebooting go to the console IPMI Screen and make sure everything is good on reboot
#58 Checking pings to make sure cluster is still online
#59 upon Reboot login and run another Windows Update pass and reboot #3
#60 Checking pings to make sure cluster is still online
#61 Login and check event logs for errors
#62 Change the Cluster Service back to Automatic
#63 Open Failover CLuster Manager and Start the Cluster Service
#64 Node should show paused leave it this way for now
#65 open Admin PowerShell and run Get-StorageJob - Waiting for Jobs to complete
#66 run get-virtual disk - Disks should show healthy and not degraded or detached
#67 run get-storagepool make sure everything is healthy
#68 Move out of maint mode on VeeamOne
#69 Inform the team to test after patching is complete
#70 Close out the ticket and patching complete
#71 Reenable the Veeam Jobs
